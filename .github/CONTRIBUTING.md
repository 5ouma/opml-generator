I happily welcome your contributions! Before you contribute, I would recommend
reading this guideline for a better development experience.

## 💬 Commit Message

I recommend you to follow [Conventional Commits] with this format.

```commit message
type(scope): Description

Body
```

[Conventional Commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org

<br />

## ❓ Pull Requests Title

You don't need to add any prefixes like `feature` or `bug fix` to the Pull
Requests title. I can recognize what kind of PR it is from labels. Please give a
clear title.

<br />

## 🪵 Commit Log

I do squash merge to the main branch to keep the commit history clean. When
merging your Pull Request, I'll add the Conventional Commits type and scope.
